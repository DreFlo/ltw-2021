            <p class = "second_title">Board:</p>
            <p class = "content">The board is comprised by a series of cavities, to be personalized by the user, and two storage spots on either side.</p>
            <p class = "content">Each user controls the side of the board they're facing and the warehouse to their right.</p>
            <p class = "content">They will each have a customizable amount of seeds in each of their cavities, ready to be played.</p>
            <p class = "second_title">How to Play:</p>
            <p class = "content">Players play on a turn by turn basis, each having to seed each time, meaning they'll have to select one of their cavities
                to start from and continue moving forward, dropping a seed in all the cavities they pass through, stopping when there are no more seeds.
            </p>
            <p class = "content">While seeding, if you encounter your own storage space, you are to seed there, continuing to the other player's side,
                but if you happen to pass through the other player's storage, you are to skip ahead, not placing any seeds there.
            </p>
            <p class = "content">If the last seed spot is your own storage space, you have another turn.</p>
            <p class = "content">If the last seed spot is one of your own and is empty, then you have the opporunity to increase the number of seeds
                in your storage spot. You can collect that last seed and the seeds on the cavity opposite to the one you landed, on your opponent's side.
            </p>
            <p class = "second_title">Ending & Winning Conditions:</p>
            <p class = "content">The game stops whenever one player can't continue to play, by having no seeds in any of their cavities, 
                except the storage spot.</p>
            <p class = "content">If the game ends, the one player who still has seeds in their own cavities, moves them to their own storage spot.</p>
            <p class = "content">The winner is determined by whoever has the most seeds in their storage spot.</p>
